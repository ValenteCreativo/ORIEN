# ORIEN

**Orchestration Rail for Infrastructure & Execution Networks**

The compute marketplace for agents.

## Overview

ORIEN is an orchestration rail where autonomous agents rent specialized compute infrastructure to execute missions. Providers list their pre-configured hardware (Mac minis, servers) with expensive software stacks, and agents pay for effective execution time.

**Key principles:**
- Agents are primary users
- Billing based on effective execution time (not idle)
- Settlements in USDC
- No scope creep: ORIEN is a rail, not a cloud, not an OS, not a DAO
